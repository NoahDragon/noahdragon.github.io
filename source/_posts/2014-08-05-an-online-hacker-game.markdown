You could start the game from [here](http://fun.coolshell.cn), hosted by [coolshell.cn](http://coolshell.cn).

Don't hesitate to use google and wikipedia to solve the puzzles.

I have posted hints and solutions on [my github](https://github.com/NoahDragon/fun.coolshell.cn), use them wisely when you get difficulties.

Enjoy :)
